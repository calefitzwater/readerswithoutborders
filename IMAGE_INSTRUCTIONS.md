# Adding the Borders Bookstore Image

I've added a section to display a black and white image of the Borders bookstore. To complete the setup:

## Steps:

1. **Find or download an image** of a Borders bookstore (exterior photo)
   - You can search for "Borders bookstore" images online
   - Make sure you have permission to use the image

2. **Save the image** in your project folder (`readers/`) with the filename:
   ```
   borders-bookstore.jpg
   ```

3. **Alternative formats**: If your image is a different format, you can either:
   - Convert it to JPG, or
   - Update the filename in `index.html` (line 40) to match your file:
     ```html
     <img src="your-image-name.png" ...>
     ```

## Image Styling

The image will automatically be:
- Converted to black and white (grayscale filter)
- Slightly darkened for a somber, nostalgic feel
- Displayed with a memorial overlay text at the bottom
- Responsive and will look good on all screen sizes

The styling creates a "sad" or nostalgic look to honor the memory of the closed bookstore, which fits perfectly with your club's theme!
